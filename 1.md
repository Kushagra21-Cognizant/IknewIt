# authentication and authorization

notes about auth.

```
    "JwtOptions": {
      "Secret": "256bitkeyhere",
      "Issuer": "issuername",
      "Audience": "audience"
    }
```
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular method for implementing authentication and authorization in web applications. JWTs are self-contained tokens that carry all the necessary information about a user within the token itself, making them stateless and easy to use across different services. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically contains the type of token and the signing algorithm used. The payload includes the claims, which are statements about an entity (usually the user) and additional data. The signature is used to verify that the token hasn't been altered.

When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client. The client then includes this token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests. The server can verify the token's signature to authenticate the user without needing to store session information. This makes JWTs particularly useful for scalable applications and microservices architectures. However, it's important to implement JWTs securely, considering aspects like token expiration, secure storage, and proper handling of sensitive data.

1. You can use the same secret key that is already included in the repo. 
1. You can also create a 256 bit key from any online website or command line. I will leave how to do this as a exercise of your own accord.
1. You can give whatever issuer name you want, or use already included value
1. same with audience
1. But, you must ensure, all the projects that consume the auth service, use the exact same values and the values are updated in the corresponding appserttings.json file.
